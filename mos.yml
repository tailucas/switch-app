# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

# config_schema:
#  - ["my_app", "o", {title: "My app custom settings"}]
#  - ["my_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
#  - ["my_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
#  - ["my_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]

config_schema:
  - ["mqtt.server", "192.168.0.5"]
  - ["mqtt.enable", true]
  - ["rpc.mqtt.enable", false]  # Disable remote control over MQTT
  #- ["i2c.enable", true]
  - ["app.mqtt_topic", "s", "switch", {title: "MQTT topic for updates"}]
  - ["app.debug", "b", false, {title: "Debug mode with additional console output"}]
  - ["app.heartbeat_pub_interval_s", "i", 10, {title: "Publish rate when idle"}]
  # GPIOs 34 to 39 are GPIs – input only pins. These pins don’t have internal pull-up or pull-down resistors.
  # https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/
  - ["app.switch_1.pin", "i", 32, {title: "GPIO switch pin"}]
  - ["app.switch_1.enabled", "b", true, {title: "Switch responds to MQTT commands."}]
  - ["app.switch_2.pin", "i", 33, {title: "GPIO switch pin"}]
  - ["app.switch_2.enabled", "b", false, {title: "Switch responds to MQTT commands."}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
